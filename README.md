## 1. Introduction to Python Packages

A Python package is a collection of modules organized into directories. Packaging allows you to structure your code, share it with others, and make it reusable across multiple projects.

A Python package is typically a directory with:
- A `__init__.py` file (may be empty)
- Other Python modules or sub-packages
- Configuration files like `setup.py` with metadata


## 2. Setting Up Your Project Structure

A well-structured project typically looks like this:

- `my_package/` (Main package directory)
  - `__init__.py` (Initializes the package)
  - `module1.py` (Example module)
  - `module2.py` (Example module)
- `tests/` (Directory for test files)
  - `test_module1.py` (Example test file)
- `setup.py` (Build configuration file)
- `README.md` (Project description)
- `LICENSE` (License information)

### Explanation of Each Component
- `my_package/`: The main package folder, containing the actual code.
- `__init__.py`: Initializes the package and allows Python to recognize it as a package.
- `setup.py`: Configuration file for building and distributing the package.
- `README.md`: Provides a description of the project for users.
- `LICENSE`: Legal information regarding how others can use your code.
- `tests/`: Directory containing test cases to validate your code.
